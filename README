This repository contains the scripts and data (with the exception of data that I do not have permission to distribute) used to perform analysis and generate figures in the manuscript [Evidence for power law scaling in species aggregation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.04159). Re-running the analysis requires both a working Python 3 environment containing the usual scientific Python packages ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) should work fine), and an R installation to make the figures.
